  title: Gradually Increase Reps
  text: "If you're new to pull-ups or struggling with them, start with assisted versions
    (using a resistance band or assisted pull-up machine) or negative pull-ups (jump
    up and slowly lower yourself down). As your strength improves, gradually increase
    the number of reps and reduce the assistance until you can do full bodyweight
    pull-ups.\r"
