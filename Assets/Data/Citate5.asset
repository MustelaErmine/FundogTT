  title: Rest and Recovery
  text: "Pull-ups can be demanding, so make sure to give your muscles enough time
    to recover. Rest for 48 hours between pull-up sessions to allow your muscles
    to repair and grow. If you train your back too frequently without proper recovery,
    you risk overtraining and stalling progress.\r"
