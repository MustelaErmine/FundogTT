  title: Engage Your Back Muscles
  text: While it's tempting to focus only on pulling yourself up, remember that the
    key to an effective pull-up lies in engaging your back muscles. Actively squeeze
    your shoulder blades together as you pull up, rather than relying solely on your
    arms. This will recruit more muscle fibers and help build strength faster.
