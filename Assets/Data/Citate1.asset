  title: Focus on Form
  text: Proper form is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of pull-ups and minimizing
    the risk of injury. Start with your arms fully extended and engage your core.
    As you pull up, keep your chest lifted and avoid swinging your body. The movement
    should be controlled and steady, targeting your back and biceps.
