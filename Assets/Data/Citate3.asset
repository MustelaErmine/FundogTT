  title: Use Different Grip Variations
  text: To develop overall upper-body strength, mix up your grip on pull-ups. Standard
    overhand grips (pronated) primarily work the back and biceps, while underhand
    grips (supinated) target your biceps more. You can also try neutral grips (palms
    facing each other) or wide grips to activate different muscle groups.
