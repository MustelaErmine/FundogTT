  title: Incorporate Auxiliary Exercises
  text: To build the necessary strength for pull-ups, include auxiliary exercises
    that target your back, shoulders, and arms. Exercises like lat pulldowns, rows,
    and dumbbell curls can help develop the muscles required for pull-ups. Building
    overall upper-body strength will make pull-ups feel easier over time.
